# About The Student Analyst

## A Blog About Cloud Computing & Emerging Tech

Student Analyst Origins
-----------------------

When I first created the Student Analyst blog during the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was simply journaling my Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Certification Journey as some form of ‘Pandemic Project’, because what extra-mural activities did we have when we were locked down?

Phones.

Screens.

Internet.

The world was a cyber haven. Everything ‘fun’ was technologically oriented. I was excited about hopping on to the internet and telling the world about AWS and all the possibilities of Cloud Computing. I eventually had to put it on hold to focus on my exams. Well, I have acquired more knowledge, more skills, and more certifications and I am ready to resume my blog, and you know what? Cloud Computing is **still** as awesome as ever, and I am enthused to start writing again.

Student Analyst 2.0
-------------------

Nostalgic rambling aside, with the new version of the Student Analyst blog, I’ll call it Student Analyst 2.0 (can’t wait to see how it evolves or perishes). I will still document my Journey through the Cloud(s) and provide more introductory and technical content that will excite you (or just me, honestly I don’t mind) and help anyone get started with Cloud Computing, Generative AI and Emerging Tech.

The main agenda of the Student Analyst has not altered drastically, at some point I wanted to turn it into an [independent AI Chatbot](https://medium.com/@ntombizakhona/trying-to-create-a-robot-content-creator-d6579b7417e) of some sort like IBM Watson, but we have ChatGPT, Grok, Bard (or is it Gemini now?) so we will leave that to them…for now. At the core of the Student Analyst, I still hope to primarily encourage the Youth of South Africa (and every other human being in existence) to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) related fields, and be active in the economical, entrepreneurial, financial, and political sphere of the nation.

Technology is advancing rapidly! I believe that the future is in radical Technological Adoption and Digital Transformation, therefore, the South African Youth, the Government and our Societies need to be consistently, continuously and adequately prepared, and know how to optimally leverage emerging systems that benefit society’s most vulnerable in an effort to develop the self as well as the whole nation.

Contributors
------------

No man is an island. I would like to collaborate with like-minded contributors, that are excited about teaching others (while learning) and sharing their experiences about Tech, Cloud and AI, and how it affects various aspects of human life, careers, hobbies, surroundings.

To be a contributor, a cloud certification (preferably AWS), and a blog or publicly accessible content would be advantageous (definitely required) and a love for continuous learning and sharing knowledge.

Conclusion
----------

The term Student Analyst encapsulates this blog very well because it emphasizes the infinite, evolutionary learning process, and the growth that occurs from analysing and applying acquired knowledge.

We will study forever, whilst analysing ourselves through introspection and developing ourselves through self-reflection, and discipline.

We will become honorary members of society and develop and uplift our communities.

…And, once again, not to sound repetitive and redundant, but in one way or the other, I hope the Student Analyst blog inspires and encourages you to get started or delve deeper into technology.
