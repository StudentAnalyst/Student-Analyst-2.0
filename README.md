# Student Analyst 2.0

Student Analyst 2.0 is a blog and learning project by **Ntombizakhona Mabaso** focused on documenting a journey through **Cloud Computing**, **Generative AI**, and **Emerging Technology**—and exploring how these systems shape society, opportunity, and the future (especially for the youth of South Africa).

## Origins

Student Analyst started in 2020, during the height of the pandemic, as a “pandemic project” and a personal journal of an **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Certification journey**. With the world locked down and life moving onto screens, the internet became a space to learn, build, and share.

The blog paused while exams and certifications took priority. Since then, the journey continued—more skills, more knowledge, more certifications—and now it’s time to resume writing with renewed momentum.

Cloud computing is still as awesome as ever.

## What is Student Analyst 2.0?

Student Analyst 2.0 is the next iteration of the blog: an evolving, experimental platform to document learning and publish both **introductory** and **technical** content across cloud and AI—content meant to excite readers, help beginners get started, and challenge curious minds.

An earlier idea was to turn Student Analyst into an independent AI chatbot (Watson-style), but the ecosystem has shifted fast—ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and others already dominate that space. For now, the focus returns to what matters most: **learning, writing, and sharing**.

## Mission

At its core, Student Analyst aims to encourage the **youth of South Africa** (and anyone anywhere) to:

- pursue **STEM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics),
- build competence in modern technology,
- participate actively in the **economic, entrepreneurial, financial, and political** future of their society.

Technology is accelerating. The future will be shaped by **radical technological adoption** and **digital transformation**, and communities need to be consistently prepared—especially in ways that uplift and protect society’s most vulnerable.

## Philosophy

The name **Student Analyst** captures the point of the project: learning is infinite, and growth comes from analyzing what we learn and applying it intentionally.

We study forever.  
We analyze ourselves through introspection.  
We develop ourselves through reflection and discipline.  
We grow into people who uplift their communities.
